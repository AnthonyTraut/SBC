The schema extraction in LD-VOWL uses a class-centric perspective, i.e., the classes are extracted first and define the view on the Linked Data source. The classes are then connected by properties and enriched by datatypes. A class centric perspective is very common in ontology engineering and fits well with the node-link paradigm of the graph visualization that the VOWL notation is based upon [13].

The extraction is realized by dynamically generated SPARQL queries revealing the schema information from a given dataset based on a couple of assumptions. ince the SPARQL endpoints of Linked Data sources can have strict limits in terms of execution time, the queries must not be too complex.

1. Extraction of classes with the most instances :
    A generic SPARQL query asking for the n classes with the most instances is sent to the endpoint first
    1.a. Filter the classes and properties of DF, RDFS, OWL and optionally SKOS
    1.b. Customise filters (add or remove class or properties)
    1.c. Choose the parameter n

2. Detection of subclasses, equivalent and disjoint classes :
    Based on (1), further SPARQL queries are sent to the endpoint in order to detect classes that can be considered equivalent, subclasses or disjoint classes. This is done by a pairwise comparison of the numbers of shared instances
for all n classes.
